		\begin{itemize}
			\item Reading can always be done, no thread or process have a \textcolor{ReneOrange}{lock} on it.
			\item One thread or process will always progress
			\item Can give an increase in performance when mostly reading
			\item If many threads or processes are trying to update, it might be very slow
			\item \textcolor{ReneOrange}{Starvation} can still occur
